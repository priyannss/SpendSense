## Why I Built SpendSense

I wanted a tool that’s easy to use, visually appealing, and tailored to my needs. Most expense trackers felt either too basic or too cluttered, so I decided to build my own with the features I care about most:

- **Quickly add income and expenses**
- **See my total balance, income, and expenses at a glance**
- **Visualize trends with charts and stats**
- **Access my data from anywhere, on any device**
- **Keep my data private and secure**

## Reflections

Building SpendSense has helped me learn a lot about full-stack development, UI/UX, and personal finance. It’s a project I use daily, and I’m always thinking of new features to add or ways to improve it.
